# Description:
A Sleepless Day is a 2D bullet-hell adventure game that follows a young schoolboy trying to get out of school while haunted by eerie monsters blocking his path. Itâ€™s left ambiguous whether the creatures are real or the result of his sleep-deprived mind, creating a tense, dreamlike journey.
